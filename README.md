A timer intended to help you through an online/take home exam!

You will be prompted to enter the number of questions and the allocated time of your exam.
Upon starting, you will be able to view time remaining for your exam, as well as a dynamically 
updating counter to let you know what question you should be on.

Please note: This assumes that all questions have the same marks, and therefore deserve the same 
amount of working time
